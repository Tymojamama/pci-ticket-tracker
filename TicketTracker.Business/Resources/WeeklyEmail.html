                This is your weekly ticket update! You are receiving this email because you have an open IT ticket that has yet to be
                completed. You will receive this email every week until the ticket is closed in order to show you what ticket-related tasks have
                recently been created and to show you what we've been working on. These updates are automatically generated
                in order to promote transparency and ensure that no one gets left behind! This gives you an opportunity to reach out
                if something doesn't seem quite right.
